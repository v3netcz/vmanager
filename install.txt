Installation instruction
========================

Following instructions are written for Apache 2.x, MySQL and PHP 5.3 on 
UNIX system (Mac OS X and Arch Linux tested). But can be used on other platforms.

Be sure you have your web environment installation running smoothly
before proceeding.

--------------

1) Check if your platform is suitable for running Nette Framework: 
		https://github.com/nette/tools/tree/master/Requirements-Checker

2) Download project source code by git (or any other method).
	Make sure you init all modules if you using alternative method.

		git clone git://github.com/v3netcz/vmanager.git myproject
		cd myproject
		git submodule init
		git submodule update

3) Set write permissions for temp and log directories

		chmod -R 777 temp
		chmod -R 777 log

	Note: It's not the best solution, if you know owner of apache process it's
		better to set ownership and not make directories world writeable at all.

4) Create virtual host for your installation and point it's document root 
	to www directory of this installation. Any other directories should be hidden
	from visitor!

	Example vhost config for apache:
		<VirtualHost *:80>
			ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost.localdomain
			DocumentRoot "/var/www/vmanager/www"
			ServerName vmanager.localhost
			ServerAlias *.vmanager.localhost

			<Directory "/var/www/vmanager/www">
				Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymlinks
				AllowOverride All
				Order allow,deny
				Allow from all

				# Path to temp or pear depends on your instalation
				php_admin_value open_basedir /var/www/vmanager/:/tmp/:/usr/share/pear/

				# For developers only
				php_admin_value xdebug.profiler_output_dir /var/www/vmanager/temp
			</Directory>
		</VirtualHost>

5) Make MySQL database and user for your installation.
		CREATE DATABASE `vmanager_myproject`;
		CREATE USER 'vmanager'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'g1Ut6NMogtyurkZnQRxcaL';
		GRANT ALL ON `vmanager_myproject`.* TO 'vmanager'@'%';
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

	Note 1: Change `vmanager_myproject` to your database name and 'vmanager' to desired username
	Note 2: '%' can be changed to localhost to allow only local connections to server.
	Note 3: It's recommended to change your password for production environment.

6) Import database structure for your project (dbdump.sql)
		mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u vmanager --password=g1Ut6NMogtyurkZnQRxcaL vmanager_myproject < dbdump.sql

7) Copy sample config file /app/config.neon.sample to /app/config.neon
8) Set your config (/app/config.neon) to match your DB configuration and your needs

8) Enjoy your instalation :-)
