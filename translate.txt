Translator instructions
=======================

This project can be easily translated by GetText. All translations are automatically
generated from PHP source code wherever __('string') is used. 

For refreshing translations of all modules just run ./tr-update.sh <lang> in your
tools directory.

This command will perform all necessary steps and update PO files in module directories.

You can edit them with any text editor or POEdit if you want. Just be sure you use UTF-8
encoding when saving your file.

After making desired changes it is necessary to compile PO files to binary form.
Just run ./tr-compile.sh in your tools directory.

If you adding new language, don't forget to include it in config 'languages'.

Thats all.
Thanks for helping with translating this project.
